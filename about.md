Maximo Mena was born in Lima, Peru. He moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in 2003 to attend Arizona State University (ASU), where he got a bachelor's degree in Computer Systems Technology.

Maximo's passion for the web was manifested early in his college career as he often found opportunities to build websites. In 2009 he got a part-time job as a web developer at ASU’s University Technology Office where he learned Drupal. Within 6 months of starting his part-time job, he was offered full-time employment. Maximo left ASU in March 2012; since then he has had the opportunity to work for a few different companies such as Goteq, Kalamuna, and Infusionsoft.

Maximo’s first language is Spanish. His parents and younger brother live in Lima, where he travels every year to visit them.
