There is times when learning things on your own can be extremely time consuming and almost unproductive. For example, a few months ago I got a Rubik's cube as a present and spent countless hours trying to solve it. At first I was determined to do it on my own, but I never got past solving one face. Finally, I listened to a friend's advice and decided to read the Rubiks.com [official guide][Rubik's cube guide]. Now I can solve the puzzle consistently.

I invite you to challenge yourself too and learn how to solve a Rubik's cube.
