The above video is from my first speech at Old Town Toastmasters. I must say I can't thank Kyle enough for recording the weekly meetings. The video of the speeches along with the written evaluations make the best feedback one can possible get.

For those of you who are not in the know, [Toastmasters International](http://www.toastmasters.org) is a leadership factory. There are more than 8 thousand Toastmasters clubs in the United States, and Old Town Toastmasters is the one I belong to.

If you would like to improve your public speaking skills and get better at running meetings, I highly recommend that you [find a club](http://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club) in your city and become a member. I find the support of my peers and their feedback invaluable in my journey to become a better communicator.
