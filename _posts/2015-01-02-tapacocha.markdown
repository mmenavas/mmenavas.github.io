I spent New Year's eve in Tapacocha, my dad's hometown. Tapacocha is a small town
in the country side of Peru and has an elevation of 10,000 feet. On January 2nd,
my dad took me for a hike to Pucaranca, and we left Tapacocha at 4:30am.

It was very cold, and I was struggling to keep up with my dad because of the altitude.
Fortunately, a close friend of my dad caught up to us and brought a donkey with him.
He let me ride the donkey for a little while until I felt better.

Riding the donkey was a little intimidating at first because I had never done it before,
but once I was on it, going up the mountain felt much easier. It was great help.

To get to Pucaranca from Tapacocha, one has to go up a mountain. The top of this mountain
is called Huanquin. From there, one can see Pucaranca's farms.
